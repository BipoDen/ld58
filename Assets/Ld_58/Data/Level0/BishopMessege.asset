      but colleagues keep noticing Henry making harsh remarks toward patients - his
      own and others\u2019. Please, talk to him before we get ourselves into trouble"

      go beyond the clinic. As for my son - I haven\u2019t gone easy on him all his
      25 years, and I\u2019m not planning to start now. - Steve B."
