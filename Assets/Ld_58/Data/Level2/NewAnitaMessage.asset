      Glad to hear from you! Yeah, I\u2019m still there - actually, I\u2019ve been

      Nick, I\u2019m actually writing to you because of something serious - thanks
      to a recent article from one of your journalists, I might get fired! - A. Snow"

      his company and haven\u2019t seen anything like what\u2019s written there!
      Nick, I really need to find your employee who writes under the pseudonym P.Duke

      easy. The management keeps journalist identities strictly confidential. We
      only contact him via email - here it is: pduke23011997@wmail.wo  But trust
      me, you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s tried to reach him about his slander.
      He\u2019s quite the ghost when it comes to replying."
