      find the words to describe how despicable that lie is! - J.Weiss"

      Chicago and even beyond. I must look like a monster in the eyes of my employees\u2026"

      your employees have never complained to you! - J. Weiss"

    Text: "8351 -I know, Jolie, but if such rumors have started, they can\u2019t
      be completely unfounded\u2026 I feel that if I leave things as they are, the
      company\u2019s reputation will suffer greatly."

      entire staff? Do you think that would stop the rumors? - J. Weiss"

    Text: "8351 - Of course not, Jolie, where did you get that idea? Besides, I value
      you especially as an employee. Replacing the staff would only reinforce the
      notion that I\u2019m some kind of tyrant\u2026 Perhaps I\u2019ll have to step
      down to keep the company\u2019s name clean."

      the company\u2019s affairs very well, and at 30 you already hold a high position
      - perhaps you\u2019ll be the next director of Nord Box."

      still in charge - don\u2019t give up! In any case, if you entrust the company
      to me, I won\u2019t let you down. - J. Weiss"
