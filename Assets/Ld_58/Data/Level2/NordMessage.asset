    Text: "Yes, my dear\u2026 unfortunately, that lying dog P.Duke has gotten to
      me as well. All this time, trouble passed us by - we watched those expos\xE9s
      about our competitors\u2026 Of course, none of those stories had a shred of
      truth, just like the recent article about me. But back then, it worked in our
      favor\u2026 Now I finally understand what our competitors must have felt. -

      acquaintances for help\u2026 I think we should leave Chicago for a while -
      until the rumors die down. - S. Nord"
